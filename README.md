### Brandie Hatch, Data Scientist

With my new skills and my extensive experience in adult instruction as a Learning Specialist. My transferable skills of communication, flexibility, patience, and authenticity are brought out when solving people-based problems for technical and non-technical audiences. I'm interested in how data science can solve for better learning solutions. For example, I would love to use my new skills to help a company using automated machinery solve for shorter, easier, and safer learning at onboarding or when learning a new skill. As another example (in non-profit space), I would like to branch out into social services and social change data science to incorporate ethical practices while making predictions. How do we remove inherent bias in our algorithms that use biased data to train our models?

Why did you choose to study data?

Data is the future! Data gives us concrete opportunities to take current data and model future opportunities.
